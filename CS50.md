## Week 0

Binary was 8 light switches

If we want to represet say number 50 we turn the light bulbus
    ?  ?  ?  ?  ?   ?   ?   ?   
    1  2  4  8  16  32  64  128
        |        |    |
        on       on   on

Computer is 0 and 1
0 is 0
01 is 1
11 is two
100 is three
...

Pseudo-code
Problem: Search Mike Smith contact
    Pick up phone book
    Open to middle of phone book
    Look at page
    if Smith is on page
        Call Mike
    Else if Smith is earlier in book
        Open to middle of left half of book
        Go back to line 3
    Else if Smith is later in book
        Open to middle of right half of book
        Go back to line 3
    Else
        Quit

### Compiler

A program that was an input and will transform in to binary language, giving the output


clang - program that compile in C
ex: clang hello.c
Exucuting this comand it create a file named a.out
That file is binary code that we can't read
So if we want then to run the program that we write:

    ./a.out
    This means, to the computer run the "a.out" file in the current directory "./"

    // A program that says hello to the world in C

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }

    >>> Terminal:
    $ clang hello.c
    $ ./a.out
    hello, world

    // if we want that the output file get personal name:
    $ clang -o hello hello.c    -> this will create a output(binary file) named hello

Variables in a string

    #inclue <cs50.h>     -> possible to use string answer in C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        string answer = get_string("What's your name?\n");
        printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
    }
    // the %s represents the placeholder that the variable answer ill go

    >>> Terminal:
    $ make string
    // with this we can forget the clang ....

### Types, formats, operators

* There are other types we can use for our variables
    * bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false
    * char, a single character like a or 2
    * double, a floating-point value with even more digits
    * float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
    * int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
    * long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher
    * string, a string of characters
* And the CS50 library has corresponding functions to get input of various types:
    * get_char
    * get_double
    * get_float
    * get_int
    * get_long
    * get_string
* For printf, too, there are different placeholders for each type:
    * %c for chars
    * %f for floats, doubles
    * %i for ints
    * %li for longs
    * %s for strings
* And there are some mathematical operators we can use:
    * \+ for addition
    * \- for subtraction
    * \* for multiplication
    * / for division
    * % for remainder
